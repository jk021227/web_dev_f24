# Response to "Five Important Considerations for Wireframing"

Reading the article made me reflect about how I approach design projects. The first point that stood out to me was **clarifying the problem**. I’ve definitely been guilty of jumping into designing solutions before fully understanding the issue at hand. Sometimes, I am so passionate about solving an issue and the product that I don't properly survey how the UI should be designed so that my product delivers a pleasant UX. I agree that this is such an important step, and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve realized halfway through a project that I missed something crucial because I didn’t dig deep enough into the problem.

Another takeaway was about **getting feedback early**. I’m not always the best at showing my work when it's rough, but the article reminded me that getting input early on can save so much time later. Plus, it brings in perspectives I wouldn’t have considered—especially from developers or other stakeholders that might have better expertise on certain aspects of the project than I do.

Lastly, I loved the point about **knowing your audience** when presenting wireframes. At times, I overthink the fidelity of my wireframes, trying to make them too polished when the team just needs a rough idea. It’s a good reminder that not everyone needs (or wants) super high-fidelity designs right off the bat. I'm definitely very guilty of doing this, so I plan to be a bit more mindful regarding this point moving forward. Overall, this was a great read, and it’s definitely made me rethink a few parts of my workflow.
