## New things I learned!

1. lines `267-289` in `styles.css`: not breaking off images manually beforehand but rather implementing it as divided pieces of a larger image with data-index positioning. Useful resources I used: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position)
2. lines `153-9` in `styles.css` for adding `.draggable` class and `97-132` in `flowers.html` JavaScript. Useful resources I used: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_onmousemove)


## Possible next steps

I want to be able to take a snapshot/screenshot of finished dressup or flower arragements. I tried it with `html2canvas` but it was hard sine the `.draggable` components weren't rendered on their **new** positions.
